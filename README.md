# FnF-Python-Bot-Flash-Version
A bot to play Friday Night Funkin' (the flash version of the game)

A side project I made using the Pyautogui module. It's mostly for fun as it only works on the flash version of the game (The desktop version doesn't seem to accept input from
pyautogui). It can beat most levels, except those with a bunch of hold notes. I made another one that does the hold notes, but it compromises the entire performance and 
efficiency of the bot so it's kinda useless lol. 

One thing to note:
I basically hard coded the bot to only work with a specific screen resolution, since the pyautogui methods that I was using required the exact pixel location.
I programmed it with a 2560 x 1440 Display; it probably doesn't work on a 1080p screen.
